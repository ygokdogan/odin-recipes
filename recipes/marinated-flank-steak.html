        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This crowd-pleasing flank steak marinade consists of the following ingredients: vegetable oil, soy sauce, red wine vinegar, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, Dijon mustard, garlic, and ground black pepper.
            As long as you marinate the flank steak in the fridge for two to six hours, you'll have great results. However, for the absolute best results, marinate overnight or up to 12 hours.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <h3>Marinade:</h3>
            <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1/3 cup low-sodium soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup red wine vinegar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>

            <h3>Steak:</h3>
            <li>1 (1 1/2-pound) flank steak</li>
        </ul>
