        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Chef John scrambles eggs in a simple tomato and pepper sauce to make his version of this Turkish dish. Spooned into a bowl, 
            and served with plenty of baguette, it's a saucy, luxurious dish like no other scrambled eggs you have ever had.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups diced fresh peppers</li>
            <li>1/4 cup diced onion</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon Aleppo chili flakes</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground blackpepper</li>
            <li>2 cups diced or chopped fresh or canned tomato</li>
            <li>1/2 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese or mozzarella</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/4 cilantro leaves</li>
            <li>crusty baguette, for serving</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt butter in olive oil over medium-high heat. Add peppers, onions, and salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, 
                until vegetables begin to soften and start to brown around the edges, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in oregano, chili flakes, black pepper, and tomato, and bring to a simmer; 
                reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in half the cheese, and as soon as it melts, add the eggs. Break yolks with the tip of a spoon, and stir into the tomato mixture for anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes, depending on the final texture you want. The longer you stir the eggs, 
                the smoother and creamier your menemen will be. If you prefer larger, identifiable pieces of egg, 
                closer to classic scrambled eggs, then only stir in the eggs briefly.</li>
            <li>Cover and cook on low until eggs are as set as you like, about 3 minutes. Turn off heat, and top with remaining cheese and a drizzle of olive oil, and another shake of chili flakes. 
                Top with cilantro, and serve with lots of crusty bread or toast.</li>

        </ol>
